# Hate Speech Detection

## Overview
Hate Speech Detection is a Python-based machine learning project aimed at identifying hate speech in textual data. This project utilizes various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify text into hate speech or non-hate speech categories.

## Features
- Preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
- Implementation of machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Deep Learning models like LSTM.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction and testing.


## Dataset
The HateSpeechDetection project uses a labeled dataset containing examples of hate speech and non-hate speech. The dataset is included in the file directory.

## Model Training
The machine learning models for hate speech detection are trained using the training set from the dataset. The models are then evaluated using the testing set
